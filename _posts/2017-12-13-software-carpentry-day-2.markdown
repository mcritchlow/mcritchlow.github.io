### General Disclaimer
This is going to be a non-curated mental dump of things I'm going to highlight as takeaways from the instructor
training. I'm not confident this will be of much value to anyone besides me ;)

### Lessons references
- [Google Doc][gdoc] for class notes and exercises
- [Instructor lesson materials][instructor-repo]

### Building Teaching Skill
- Developing good exercises in real time can be difficult, but is an important skill.
- [Software Carpentry's learner profiles][profiles]
- Learning profiles remind me a lot of [personas][personas] in Agile project management.

### Live Coding
- Embrace mistakes and EXPLAIN them as you fix them. Don't just "oops, sorry" and fix it quietly
- Have fun!
- Use illustrations
- Be mindful of fonts and contrast. White background with dark text, large font
- Stand up and move around the room
- when writing code say what you're doing out loud
- using nano actually can help slow us down, because it's less familiar than a "favorite" editor

### Workshop environment
- "Big Picture" slides. Can include logistics (where are the bathrooms) but also what SC is, why SC is important, etc.
- Introductions are helpful to put people at ease
- Clarify learning objectives
- Set tone of workshop, try to demonstrate excitement and interest in the topic
- Give them setup for success. Laptop, pen and paper, etc.
- Tell people to ask questions as needed (with stickies)
- review prerequisites
- consider an icebreaker as an exercise "download this excel file and fix it up as much as you can in 5 mins"
- really highlight the feedback loop. most people eye roll with this stuff, but mention that the course is not a fixed,
  rigid thing and can be tailored more dynamically to the needs of the class.
- highlight the pre-class survey to mention backgrounds, what people are interested in, and that we'll make sure to hit
  on the things they highlighted as being interested in

### Introduce yourself effective
- What characteristics do you want to convey about yourself?
- What will you need to say to convey those characteristics?
- Why are you teaching a Software or Data Carpentry workshop?
- What should you be careful not to say?
- Describe the prerequisites (expectations of background knowledge)

[Naupaka's great introduction slides][naupaka] - great model to follow!

### Software Carpentry: How we operate
- [Mentors][mentors] seems really great. I had no idea this was a thing

### Using the SC/DC names
The names “Software Carpentry” and “Data Carpentry” and their respective logos are all trademarked. You may only call a workshop a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop if:

- it covers the core topics,
- at least one instructor is certified,
- you run our standardized pre- and post-workshop assessments and ensure everyone participates, and
- you send us summary information about attendees (at a minimum, the number of people who attended).

### What is the "core" for SC and DC
A Software Carpentry workshop must include lessons on version control (e.g. git), the shell, and a programming language (e.g. R or Python).

A Data Carpentry workshop must include a Data Carpentry lesson on data organization and three other modules in the same domain from the Data Carpentry curriculum.

### Self-assessments
[Dunning-Kruger Effect][dk-effect] - the less people know about a subject, the less accurate their estimate of their
knowledge is.

### Wrapping Up
- be sure to carve out at least 15 minutes at the end, and don't skip over it
- recap what we've done and learned
- if we missed anything, how can they find more info
- end on a high note, even if didn't get through everything
