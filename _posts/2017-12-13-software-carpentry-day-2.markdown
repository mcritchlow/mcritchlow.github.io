### General Disclaimer
This is going to be a non-curated mental dump of things I'm going to highlight as takeaways from the instructor
training. I'm not confident this will be of much value to anyone besides me ;)

### Lessons references
- [Google Doc][gdoc] for class notes and exercises
- [Instructor lesson materials][instructor-repo]

### Building Teaching Skill
- Developing good exercises in real time can be difficult, but is an important skill.
- [Software Carpentry's learner profiles][profiles]
- Learning profiles remind me a lot of [personas][personas] in Agile project management.

### Live Coding
- Embrace mistakes and EXPLAIN them as you fix them. Don't just "oops, sorry" and fix it quietly
- Have fun!
- Use illustrations
- Be mindful of fonts and contrast. White background with dark text, large font
- Stand up and move around the room
- when writing code say what you're doing out loud
- using nano actually can help slow us down, because it's less familiar than a "favorite" editor
