### General Disclaimer
This is going to be a non-curated mental dump of things I'm going to highlight as takeaways from the instructor
training. I'm not confident this will be of much value to anyone besides me ;)

### Lessons references
- [Google Doc][gdoc] for class notes and exercises
- [Instructor lesson materials][instructor-repo]

### Good questions
- Good multiple choice questions. More important is what the _wrong_ answers are than the right ones.
- This helps address learning gaps people might have
- Does this make me hate the Git questions in the lessons any less? TBD..

### Short term memory
- Exposing students to lots of new information, so it's all in short term memory
- Explicit about pieces to complex
- Encourage at beginning of class to have everything "ready". Laptop, text editor, paper and pen. Give them a recipe for
  success "mis en place" :)
- Example: for loop in python.
  * talk about what a variable is
  * what a collection of stuff is (list)
  * what's happening in the body of the loop
  * now introduce the list and iteration, conditions
- Concept/Mind map is a good way of externalizing an internal understanding of a domain. See [examples from lesson][mind-map]
- [Concept map for Git][git-mind-map]

### Cognitive load
- Faded examples. Create a scaffolding, and then slowly have them complete more and more of the solution
- Things seen together are remembered (or mis-remembered) in chunks. Love this..
- Teaching consists of loading short-term memory and reinforcing it long enough for items to be transferred to long-term memory.

### Creating a positive learning environment
- It's ok to make mistakes
- encourage learning from one another
- People learn best when they see the utility in what they’re learning, so teach what’s most immediately useful first.
- Teach most useful stuff first. Less time to master, highest value. "git status"
- Be clear about learning objectives
- Provide opportunities to reflect

### Things to NOT do
- Saying that tools like Excel and Word are stupid. OS preferences, etc.
- Diving into complex/detailed discussion on things
- "I don't know" -> "I don't know, but I can figure out how"
- Avoid "just"

### Psychological Demotivators
- stereotype threat: only small % of devs are women
- encourage people to learn in groups/pairs
- be sure and reference the code of conduct
- encourage people to look for role models
- share mistakes with audience, help to normalize it
- avoid unnecessary jargon and acronyms
- [UK Home Office Accessibility Posters][posters]

### Creating a positive learning envirnment
- growth mindset = anyone can learn anything
- fixed mindset = "I'll never be good at math"
- [growth vs fixed mindset assessment][mindset-assessment]
- errors are **essential** to learning

### Praise influences mindset
- 3 types of praise performance-based, effort-based and improvement-based
- We're used to performance-based
- effort focuses on learners hard work
- Improvement-based praise is related to praise based on effort, but explicitly draws a learner’s attention to the progress they've made

### Habits of lifelong learners
- Growth mindset and grit promote learning by making effort a positive thing.
- Successful lifelong learners aren't embarrassed to ask for help.
