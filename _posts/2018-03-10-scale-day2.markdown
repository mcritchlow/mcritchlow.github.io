## Attaca: Git-esque Version Control for Absurd Quantities of Data ##
* [Summary][attaca-summary]

* Git LFS - stores large files outside of Git, in external server. So not
  actually part of the Git repo.
* Add multi-blog files (at a certain size threshold. Can share smaller blobs
  between files
* Blobs are stored in object store (could use sharded K/V store like Cassandra)
* Ref store sits next to object store to guarantee consistency
* Why will it handle such large files? It can offload them to storage system.
  Hash-splitting
* Ceph/RADOS is used at CERN handling multiple petabytes of data
* Hashsplitting means even very large files are efficiently stored between
  mutations
* Alternative object stores:
    * Cassandra/Scylla?
    * dat?
* Alternative ref stores:
    * [Vmware Haret?][vmware-haret]
* Will have pluggable frontends too. Attaca + Subito
* Subito: highly work-in-progress Git-like frontend for Attaca
* Attaca: content addressable storage w/ upgradeable/multi-hash support
* Attaca kinda like IPFS seems like..
* Considering RDF for extensible commit metadata (how dataset was generated)

## Bacon Flavored Open Source Do's and Don'ts
* [Summary][bacon-summary]
* Jono: Ubuntu Community Manager, worked with GitHub and Xprize, O'Reilly, Forbes,
  Huawei, Google, Microsoft, Deutsche Bank..
* Trial and Error
    * _must_ experiment, there's no hard recipes for this stuff
    * therefore some things are going to fail, so have to set expectations

### Lessons Learned
* Openness/Transparency
    * GitLab debacle example, but they were completely open and the community
      rallied behind them. Live youtube stream, google doc, etc.
* Inclusivity
    * Including differences in how we solve problems, differing views of the
      world
* Focus on People and Relationships
* Asynchronous, Hackable Workflow
* Stoic Management of Conflict
    * Stoicism - level of control of emotion/reactions
    * 7 habits of highly effective people
    * [The obstacle is the way][obstacle-book]
    * [The daily stoic][stoic-book]
* Company Bias in Some Quarters
