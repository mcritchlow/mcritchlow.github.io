## Attaca: Git-esque Version Control for Absurd Quantities of Data ##
* [Summary][attaca-summary]

* Git LFS - stores large files outside of Git, in external server. So not
  actually part of the Git repo.
* Add multi-blog files (at a certain size threshold. Can share smaller blobs
  between files
* Blobs are stored in object store (could use sharded K/V store like Cassandra)
* Ref store sits next to object store to guarantee consistency
* Why will it handle such large files? It can offload them to storage system.
  Hash-splitting
* Ceph/RADOS is used at CERN handling multiple petabytes of data
* Hashsplitting means even very large files are efficiently stored between
  mutations
* Alternative object stores:
    * Cassandra/Scylla?
    * dat?
* Alternative ref stores:
    * Vmware Haret?
* Will have pluggable frontends too. Attaca + Subito
* Subito: highly work-in-progress Git-like frontend for Attaca
* Attaca: content addressable storage w/ upgradeable/multi-hash support
* Attaca kinda like IPFS seems like..
* Considering RDF for extensible commit metadata (how dataset was generated)
