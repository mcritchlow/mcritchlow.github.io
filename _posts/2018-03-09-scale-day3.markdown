## Endless OS: A desktop for the next billion users
* [Summary][endless-summary]
* From About page:
```
Computing is one of the greatest revolutions in human history. Yet, it remains
out of reach for half the planet. We created Endless OS – a free and robust
computing solution – so people everywhere have access to relevant information
and technology.

Our goal is to build a global platform for digital literacy.

What happens when a billion people get computers?
```
* Today there is a *huge* gap between those who have computers and those who
  don't
* While more people have phones (~5b vs ~1b) people still need a computer for
  productivity
* Desktop users convert more to sales :)
* Global average of internet coverage is 53%
* Biggest barrier for cost of entry is internet, not hardware
* On average, ppl can afford *300MB* per month, but average PC consumes *60GB*
* US can't even afford infrastructure for internet to all, would cost billions
* Endless preloads apps to cache data locally, can refresh on things like cheap
  overnight data plans, FM radio signal, mesh network, etc.
* 80% of most popular Wikipedia content can be compressed to 1GB. So endless
  provides this
* More than 100 free apps and curated content for all ages and occasions. Does
  not require an internet connection
* Plea: Help build software that is mindful of users' data.
    * *Don't* assume people have 100% connection.
    * Build in offline features
* Desktop designed to model the UI/UX of a phone, since that's what the target
  demographic is more familiar with
* Built on GNOME and Debian
* Use [OS tree][os-tree] and atomic updates to make it easier for people to update their
  computer
* Using [Flatpak][flatpak] and [Flathub][flathub] for managing apps
* Considering micro-financing for people to lease solar panels (for power) and
  an Endless computer
* [Endless community site][endless-community] for getting involved
* "offline first"
