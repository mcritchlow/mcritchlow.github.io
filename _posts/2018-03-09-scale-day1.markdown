## Postgres Partitioning ##
* [Summary][postgres-partitioning]
* [Slides][pg-slides]
* How to break up massive DB tables, partitioning. Worst example he saw was *1k*
  partitions in a _single_ table.
* What table partitioning is
* How it was implemented
* the new implementation

### Why partitioning?
Performance:
* As table size grows, queries slow down, even with indexing
* Data access patterns (users table, not active) may dictate only a small
  portion of a table need to be queried against

Manageability:
* Allow data to be added/removed much easier
* Maintenance commands (vacuum, reindex, cluster) can focus on active data

Scalability:
* Work around hardware constraints (disk size, speed)
* Maintain performance, manageability over magnitudes more data

### History of Partitioning
< 8.1 manual partitioning via inheritance/views
v8.1 Constraint Exclusion ( focus queries against partition table set )
v10 Declarative Partitioning ( active partitioning development in PG )


### Partitioning terminology
* Range Partitioning - defined by specific range of data, like a `created_by` timestamp
* List Partitioning - specific list of values (states, hash, zip codes, alpha, userid%3 )

### Creating Partitioned Tables
* Should it be indexed? -- adds complexity, administration cost, app changes
* Should it be partitioned? -- adds complexity, admin cost, indexing, # rows,
types of queries, data growth

### Creating Partitioned tables
* "old way" create a "parent" table
    * no primary key on a partition table :scream:
    * define "child" partitions (use a constraint, columns from base table) uses
      INHERITS (parent)
    * add constraints to child table via `ALTER_TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES`
    * add indexes to child table via normal `CREATE INDEX`
    * define your own naming scheme for "child tables"
    * build mechanism to route data from parent table to child tables on
      insert/update/delete as a hook/trigger

* "new way" declarative partitioning
    * Syntax mostly the same when defining table, but now have `PARTIION_BY_RANGE (payment_date)`
    * still no primary key :scream:
    * Child table defined via `PARTITION OF parent`. All columns still come from
      base table
    * Still need to have non-overlapping `CONSTRAINT`

_note_: Can still use the "old way" in PG 10, and the differences between syntax isn't
very significant.

### Automating maintenance
* Deterministic partitions can be pre-created (a-z partitions for user table)
* Triggers/functions can be dynamically generated
* Partition structure doesn't have to be complete
* `generate_series()` is your friend
* [PG Partman extension][partman]

### A Unique Problem
* Work around for partition key
* constraint defines unique sets
* add unique index to each partition
* PG 11 will handle this automagically

## Multi-Container Deployment with Ansible Service Broker
* [Summary][ansible-summary]
* [Slides][ansible-slides]
* Ansible Service Broker == [Automation Broker][automation-broker]

### Provisioning
* Create a full stack of cluster resources - DB, API Service, Frontend
* Integrate with external services - legacy apps, traditional DB cluster,
  appliances.
* Post-install bootstrapping - init a DB, restore backup, create resources in
  the application
    * run a single Pod to completion
    * run a job
    * use config management
    * perform manual tasks
* Requirements for provisioning (they bundle in "meta container")
    * Cluster assets (manifest `yml`)
    * External service assets (location, credentials)
    * Application assets (seed data, config)
    * Runtime tooling (template engine, config management, app clients)

### MetaContainer / Service Bundle
* bundles everything you need at provision time
* immutable, can version + sign it
* can bind/unbind (say to DB) via credentials/setup
* runs to completion as a pod in your cluster
* testable and reproducible (can use in CI lifecycle)

### Service Catalog
* provides composable services to applications
* Actions
    * provision/deprovision
    * bind/unbind
* self-service provisioning
* client -> service catalog --> (broker/broker/broker)
* [Open Service Broker API][osb-api]
* [OpenShift Origin][openshift]

### Automation Broker
* Service Bundles
    * are catalog entries
    * run to completion for each operation
    * run in a secure sandbox
    * remove need to make your own broker
* automation broker --> container registry((1-m) service bundles)
* Actions
    * *Must* implement Provision and Deprovision
    * _May_ implement Bind and Unbind
* `apb` tool manages the broker
    * `apb init <project>` => `apb.yml` file for project
    * yml file holds metadata and plans
* Ansible Playbook Bundle
    * has ansible, minimal RHEL image, directory of files (provision.yml, ...)
* [APB Demo Repo][apb-demo]

## System76 HiDPI Daemon
* [Summary][hidpi-summary]
* Mostly a demo talk with some discussion about how they pulled it off technically.
* Unfortunately for me, it's entirely targeted towards Mutter, so while any
* Ubuntu/Gnome distro can probably leverage this, it's not going to help me out
  with i3wm..

## Ubuntu: Lessons Learned
* [Summary][ubuntu-summary]
* Jono's flight was delayed, so starting off with general Ubuntu Q+A
  which is a carryover from the last session
* You miss every shot you don't take
    * had never seen a "community manager" position, but went for it
    * i wonder if Samvera will end up with a formal community manager..
* Diversity of participation is important
    * in 2006, linux was about a) men b) programmers
    * focused on not just devs but documentation, art, testers,
      internationalization, etc.
* Release cadence works
    * mental model of, at any time, where you're at with a given release cycle
    * Ubuntu does every 6mo
* On-ramps and enablement are critical
    * New to creating something of value (*themselves* and *project*)
    * *developers*: how to participate, setup toolchain, skills to participate
      (docs,training), what to do, how to get help, do it, get reviewed and
validated.
    * core contributors are different than people who build apps off the core,
      they care about different things. The latter want documentation that works
and a stable core.
* Expectations are important and often poorly communicated
    * what people _say_ they want isn't often what they _actually_ want
* Scale is tough..
    * More than 1M people on forum, 100's of devs
    * Be explicit about you react to scale. Mentoring programs, create
      opportunities for people to be social. In person meetings critical.
    * First dev summit was ~80 devs, the last in person was 800..
* Most people need direction, not options
    * "Here are all these ways to help" _isn't productive_
    * "Hey, would you mind doing this?" _is_
* Well focused work can deliver great results
    * Ubuntu convergence/phone debacle..
    * but they had a core apps initiative w/ the community where they wanted to
      create core apps and provide early SDK access. was very successful because
it was a very focused, targeted, project.
* Change and habits take time
    * "change is bad" people can't win..
* Code is an artifact of community
    * source code is tangible evidence that a community is doing things
    * but it is not the community. you can have code and a crap community that
      no one wants to contribute to.
* The biggest ideas can be carefully managed
    * It's about breaking things down into small pieces.
    * Whether it's a complex dev project or a CEO who want to do the Ubuntu phone and hire 150 devs
immediately to do it.
* You can think you know it all. You don't
